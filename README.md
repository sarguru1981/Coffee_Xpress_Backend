# Coffee Xpress App Backend
The Coffee Xpress App Backend is the server-side implementation for the Coffee Xpress application. This project provides the backend infrastructure necessary to support the functionality of the Coffee Xpress app, which allows users to browse and order coffee and other beverages from a menu, track their orders, and manage their accounts.

## Overview
The Coffee Xpress app backend is built using Golang (Go) programming language and MongoDB database. It serves as the middleware between the frontend client and the database, handling user authentication, order management, menu management, and other essential operations.

### Project Structure
The initial part implemented focuses on designing the project structure and setting up the basic routing for the Coffee Xpress app backend.
