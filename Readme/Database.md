# Database Logic
The **database** package plays a critical role in facilitating communication between the Coffee Xpress backend application and the MongoDB database. Within this package, the **DBinstance** function serves as the entry point, responsible for creating a MongoDB client instance and establishing a connection to the MongoDB server running locally at **127.0.0.1:27017**. This function utilizes the **mongo.NewClient** method to instantiate a new client with the provided connection options. Upon successful connection, it returns the client instance, enabling subsequent database operations. Additionally, the **OpenCollection** function is designed to access a specific collection within the connected database, allowing the backend application to interact with data stored in MongoDB. By encapsulating these functionalities within the **database** package, the application achieves modularity and abstraction, promoting code maintainability and facilitating future enhancements or modifications to the database interaction logic.
